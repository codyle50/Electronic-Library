The purpose of an e-library is to store, access and update departments and related digital books in PDF format. Here, various books can be created or update easily, which helps keep information up-to-date. Instant availability of these resources helps users save time, prioritize other tasks, and store the found resources for future use. E-library can be use by role as a librarian offers free e-books for making a free-public library or a customer who can read and download e-books freely.
